The main purpose of this application is to introduce a Personal Diary on your mobile device. I would like to call it Dear Diary. Writing a Personal Diary has been a habit for generations. It help track the events as well as stroll in the memory lane at times when you need it. It’s a techno age and now there is hardly any individual left who doesn't use Mobile device. Hence I am creating this web Application so you can maintain your Diary at the comfort of your mobile.The main features of this application would be not only can a person write but you can upload photos here so as to remember important moments also an added feature where you can put any appointments in the diary and it will show up as per your preference (on the day/a day before) as a reminder so that you won’t miss it. Also you can add any links to the diary that could be accessed as and when needed. This diary will have a pass-code to enter for security reasons though it won’t allow you to make changes in dates which are past in order to make sure that your events in the diary remain as u have written it at the time just like it used to be in regular diaries. I have carried out basic research on Mobile apps, I could not find any diary application which allows to upload pictures and to put reminders also the outlook of the diary is not impressive.
